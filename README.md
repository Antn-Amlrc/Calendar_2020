All wording to those solutions can be found on this site : https://adventofcode.com/
Sometimes both parts of the problem are mixed together but in some exercices I tried to implement a way to separate them.
Indications to switch between parts are always at the beginning of the solution files (if they are).
Both parts can also be in different files if necessary for better understanding.

Note that the purpose of this challenge was to find the solution quickly.
Therefore, my code can be improved but I chose to share my quickthinking abilities and programming skills more than a final optimized program.
